    "\"Europe is a large coffee market, accounting for about one-third of global consumption\" (CBI.eu). The Netherlands is one of the largest consuming markets of coffee in Europe with an approximate of 5.6% of European consumption. Since COVID-19 the consumption of coffee have caused a sharp reduction in out-of-home coffee consumption, this has affected coffee shops that supply the out-of-home segment with high quality coffee(CBI.eu).\n",

    "Nevetheless, the demand for high quality coffee and caf√© experiences shows no sign of dissapearing according to a study done in the UK last year, when the pandemic was at it's peak.\n",

    "The city of Amsterdam is one of the most visited and populated cities of The Netherlands. The city itself provides a lot of business opportunities and is a huge attractor of tourism. The market in Amsterdam is highly competitive, and a lot of new places have been business have been started in the past few years.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have always been a refined coffee drinker and absolutely love the taste of it. I am going to explore the opporunity to open up a new coffee-bar in Amsterdam city center. I think after the pandemic the demand for out-of-home coffee experiences will only generate more traffic, and this might be a very good time to start a new company.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project deals with discussing the neighborhood of Amsterdam, The Netherlands. I am going to identify the best place to open up a coffee shop in Amsterdam, with coffee shop we mean a place to drink coffee, and not a place to get softdrugs."

    "My imaginary company (Amsterdam Aroma House) is targeting the city of Amsterdam to open up a new coffee bar. The new coffee bar is planning to be of high-quality, and is expected to compete with the large diverse portfolio of companies that supply coffee to the consumer. Consequently, we are not only looking at coffee-bars, for instance, we include sandwich bars, breakfast bars, bagel shops, and bakeries. The foremost reason for including these types of companies is because a high amount of sales come\n",

As has been said, Amsterdam is a very popular city to start up a new company, especially in the vicinity of hospitality. We have to identify the optimal location by looking at population density, amount of competition, location, and types of companies that supply coffee.\n",
